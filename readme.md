<h2>Steps on how to run the programme</h2>

The programme has been hosted on Github Pages at the following link. Please click on the link given below and migrate to the website. It is recommended that you view

this on a system having 15.6" inches screen for better UI. Also, please have a working internet connection.

https://anubhav9.github.io/Zomentum-v1/#/

However, if you wish to see the source code, it is available at source code/lib/main.dart.

To run this on your local system, it is recommended to have the following things installed

a) Android Studio with Flutter Plugin

Open the main.dart file and in the Android Studio Terminal, run the command, 'flutter pub get' and then install the necessary packages by pressing the package get button in the 

pubspec.yaml file.

<h2>Some explaination on how this programme is working</h2>

This is basically a use case of CRUD in databases. Firestore which is a NoSQL database is used in this project. The queries are similar to the normal DBMS queries that we 

generally write. It is a realtime database hence the changes are visible in Real Time. Please ote that the database is currently open and is available for public view or in 

other words is in test mode. Security rules for the same has not been set and this dataabse will expire after 30 days ie on 30th Sep 2020.

I didn't have to generate the HTML or the Javascript Files. These were automatically being generated by the Dart Programming Language. Since, it is build on Flutter it is very

easy to migrate it to Android/iOS/Desktop App.  This also follows the principle of REST paradigm as mentioned in the problem statement.
